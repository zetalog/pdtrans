                   Source Code Localization Framework

This program is developed for a localization project, worked for NEC
product to convert it into English.

The translation framework can grap all strings from the source code,
and after letting translators to add localized language, the framwork
can replace all strings into the localized language strings back into
the source code. The framework implements several kind of grammar
plug-ins to deal with that translation project. But you may be able to
add more plug-in for your own project.
